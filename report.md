# Digital Forensics Lab Report â€“ Lab 2

## Objective
To recover deleted or lost files from a FAT12 filesystem image using forensic tools and to compare their effectiveness.

## Key Activities
- Mounted a FAT12 image and verified SHA1 hash of image and mounted loop device
- Identified text strings in specific offsets containing potentially suspicious messages
- Used Scalpel, Foremost, and Photorec to recover files
- Compared results and discussed differences in recovery success rates and file types
- Analyzed parsed timeline (CSV) using spreadsheet software to identify modified or deleted files

## Summary
Each tool used a different signature-based algorithm and configuration. Differences in file recovery rates show that multiple tools should be used for a comprehensive forensic investigation.
